I did the Data Cleaning and Features engeneering in a first file called "DataProcessing.Rmd" and then did the Data Analysis on a second file called "DataAnalysis.Rmd".
The description of the dataset is in the "DataAnalysis" file.
The original 10gb dataframe was from the NYC website, you can find a randomly sampled version of it in the Datasets folder under the name "Taxi2017_Dataset.csv".
The "DataAnalysis" starts the analysis by importing the "ProcessedDataset.rds" file which is the file exported from the "DataProcessing" program.
